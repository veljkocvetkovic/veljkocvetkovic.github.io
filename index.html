          Student Intern at <a href="https://cpes.vt.edu/">CPES</a>. Worked under supervision of Dr. Dushan Boroyevich on real-time UART communication protocols on ESP-32 microcontrollers and PEBB (Power Electronics Building Block) hardware controller. Used Tektronix MSO64 6 Series 4GHz 25GS/s oscilloscope to measure signals from PEBB. Created documetation for HMI using Raspberry Pi display.

          <br><br>
          Worked on video editing for tutorial presented on High-Voltage-Direct-Current (HVDC) systems - presented by Dr. Dushan Boroyevich. Also supported lab equipment installation as a volunteer in new high-power lab (power supplies, oscilloscopes, soldering stations, waveform generators, multimeters, computers, etc.).
